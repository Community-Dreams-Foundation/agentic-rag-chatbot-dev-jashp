Subject: Global Infrastructure Expansion and Data Governance Framework

1. Executive Summary
    As of early 2026, the organization is pivoting toward a "Regional First" infrastructure model. The primary objective is to establish three new data centers in Singapore, Frankfurt, and Mumbai by Q4 2026. This expansion aims to reduce global API latency to a target threshold of under 45 milliseconds for 98% of users.

2. Technical Infrastructure Specifications
    To support the Agentic RAG CLI and similar internal tools, the following hardware standards are mandatory for all new regional hubs:

        -> Primary Compute: NVIDIA H200 Tensor Core GPUs for localized inference.

        -> Storage Architecture: NVMe-over-Fabrics (NVMe-oF) with a minimum throughput of 1.2 TB/s.

        -> Network Protocol: Migration from IPv4 to a strict IPv6-only internal backbone to simplify routing and improve security.

        -> Cooling System: Implementation of liquid immersion cooling to achieve a Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.08.

3. Data Governance & Security Protocols
    Under the new "Security Mindset" initiative, all external API integrations (including Feature C weather calls) must adhere to the following:

        -> Audit Frequency: Automated security scans of the Python Sandbox environment will occur every 72 hours.

        -> Data Residency: Any data retrieved from public APIs for analysis must be purged from temporary cache within 30 minutes of the session termination.

        -> Encryption: All data "at rest" in the persistent memory files (USER_MEMORY.md and COMPANY_MEMORY.md) must be encrypted using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 algorithm.

4. Human Resources & Project Leadership
    The expansion project, codenamed "Project Horizon," will be overseen by the following key personnel:

        -> Project Director: Marcus Vane.

        -> Lead DevOps Engineer: Elena Rodriguez.

        -> Compliance Officer: David Chen (Responsible for vetting all third-party API usage).

5. Budgetary Constraints
    The initial capital expenditure (CAPEX) for the Frankfurt hub is set at $4.2 million. A contingency fund of 12% has been authorized to account for supply chain fluctuations in semiconductor procurement.
